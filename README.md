Code from BlueJelly Hands-on by JellyWare

This code works with BLE-Nano2 (nRF52-based BLE device) decribed in following article:
http://jellyware.jp/kurage/blenano/blenano2_minibread.html

Basically, this is a really simple device with 2 features:

- Allow reading ADC value (10bit) from one characteristic
- Allow writing to another characteristic that controls LED on/off

UUID of service and characteristics needs to be changed depending on what UUID is programmed in firmware.
